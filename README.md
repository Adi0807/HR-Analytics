HR Attendance Analysis and Reporting
Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attendance data to reveal trends, leave patterns, and operational efficiency insights. Using Python, Excel, and Power BI, the analysis equips HR teams with actionable insights to optimize scheduling, track leave trends, and improve workforce planning.

Objectives
Standardize and analyze attendance records to identify patterns in employee attendance and leave types.
Visualize attendance metrics with Power BI dashboards, focusing on metrics like work-from-home days, leave utilization, and attendance consistency.
Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic HR and operational decision-making.
Data
The data includes attendance records for April, May, and June 2022, with a variety of leave types and attendance codes such as:

P: Present
WO: Weekly Off
PL: Paid Leave
WFH: Work from Home
SL: Sick Leave
LWP: Leave without Pay, among others.
An Attendance Key sheet provides code definitions for accurate analysis.

Process
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used Python and Excel for initial data cleanup, standardization of attendance codes, and monthly record integration.
Data Analysis: Conducted an in-depth examination of leave types, attendance frequencies, and overall trends to understand key patterns.
Power BI Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards to make insights accessible and actionable for HR and management stakeholders.
Key Insights
Attendance Trends: High utilization of weekly offs and holidays, with most employees maintaining regular attendance.
Leave Patterns: Paid Leave and Work from Home are the most common types of leaves, while other leave types (e.g., Sick Leave, Leave without Pay) are less frequently used.
Monthly Variations: Patterns show an increase in leave days and Work from Home in certain months, providing insights for HR to plan staffing better.
Operational Planning: The data indicates potential staffing adjustments during peak leave periods to ensure smooth operations.
